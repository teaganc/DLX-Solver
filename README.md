# DLX-Solver

This is an implmentation of Algorithm X using Dancing Links. DLX is a class of contraint problems.
DLX (with colors) form a superset over the class of Contraint Satisfaction Problems. 

In drivers you will find a general CLI version of the solver. As well, a driver for solving sudoku is provided as a example of how one might directly interface with the solver. The sudoku solver comes with a python OpenCV image processor and Go service to be deployed to the web to solve images of incomplete sudoku images.
